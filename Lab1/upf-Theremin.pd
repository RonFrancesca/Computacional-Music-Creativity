#X text 896 534 Root mean square values (rms) \, are logarithmic values
between 0 and 1 \, where 0 corresponds to 0 dB and 1 to 100 dB. For
this reason \, I have the vertical slider for the amplitude going from
0 and 100 (representing the dB) \, which are converted to rms with
the dbtorms object \, which output vary between 0 and 1;
#X text 879 669 The vline generate linear ramp which level and timing
are determined by message. In this case the level is value coming from
the conversation from db to rms and the timing is 200ms.;

#X text 21 53 The pitch is limited between 21 and 108 \, which are
the range of MIDI keyboard. The value of the pitch is going to be modulated
from the vibrato. It is easier to modulate the frequency before the
mtof object \, especially because the semitone are fixed related to
the pitch as MIDI. If it would have done afterwards \, for every single
frequency it should have been calculated the interval of the -+ semitone.

#X text 820 116 Vibrato: the vibrato is a modulation of the frequency.
This is done applying an oscillator to the current value of the pitch.
Doing it before the mtof object \, allow to keep the range fixed and
valid for all the note \, otherwise it would have been necessary to
reconsider the distance between tone every time. The frequency vary
between 0 ansd 10 Hz and the amplitude 2 semitone. Those values have
been selected for the results thye give to us. The expression if($f1
== 0 \, 0 \, 1) has been added to avoid storing value from the vibrato
aplitude when the frequency was = 0 In fact \, the oscillatior is moltiply
on the cold index \, which means its values is going to be stored also
if there is not freqyuency. In this way \, when there is no frequency
on the vibrato control \, the expression set 0 (deleting the "storing"
effect) and when there is a frequency it set 1;
