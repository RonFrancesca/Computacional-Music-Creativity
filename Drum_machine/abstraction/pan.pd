#X text 395 349 I agree that the right and left channel could have
been treated differently \, for example splitting the signal already
inside the instrument. I did not want to do it because I believe it
is better to create different patch for different function and also
ebcasue I migth need this patch in the future so it would be easier
to re-use the patch.;
#X text 402 44 I am sorry for the messy connection but I really did
not get how to move this canvas around. By the way \, the patch pan
get a signal as input and give two signal as output \, which would
be the right and left channel. In order to do this \, I am splitting
the sound and I am multiply one side for the value of the slider (going
from 0 to 1) and the other side for 1-the value coming from the slider.
I actually have some doubts regarding how the signal is going to be
maintained in a proper way or we are losing something doing this way
\, like energy of the signal or something.;
#X text 404 224 The loadbang to the message 0.5 assure that when the
patch is instantiated \, the pan is going to be set in the middle.
