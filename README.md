Repository with solution to exercises and implementation of digital instruments for Computational Music Creativity. 

The repository has been created also as a collection of solutions to different assignment of the course in computational musici creativity at the Universidad Pompeu Fabra: https://www.upf.edu/web/smc/computational-music-creativity. 

The content of every folder and file is described in this file. 

### Lab1: Introuduction to Pure Data. The folder contains three patches:
-  upf-counter.pd: simple counter in pure data 
-  upf-sequencer.pd: 16-step sequencer in pure data
-  upf-Theremin.pd: oscillator with vibrato control. Both the frequency and the amplitude of the vibrato can be controlled by sliders. 

### Theremin-gui: 
Oscillator with vibrato control, version with a gui and MIDI object. Frequency and amplitude of both oscillator and vibrato can be controlled by MIDI object (MIDI controller) or simply by the sliders from the Theremin-GUI.
