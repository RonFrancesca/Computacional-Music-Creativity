# Computacional Music Creativity

Repository with solution to exercises and implementation of digital instruments for Computational Music Creativity. 

The repository has been created also as a collection of solutions to different assignment of the course in computational musici creativity at the Universidad Pompeu Fabra: https://www.upf.edu/web/smc/computational-music-creativity. 

The content of every folder and file is described in this file. 

#### Lab1: Introuduction to Pure Data. The folder contains three patches:
-  upf-counter.pd: simple counter in pure data 
-  upf-sequencer.pd: 16-step sequencer in pure data
-  upf-Theremin.pd: oscillator with vibrato control. Both the frequency and the amplitude of the vibrato can be controlled by sliders. 

#### Theremin-gui: 
Oscillator with vibrato control, version with a gui and MIDI object. Frequency and amplitude of both oscillator and vibrato can be controlled by MIDI object (MIDI controller) or by the sliders from the Theremin-GUI.

#### Drum_machine 

Drum machine with 8 instruments, independent gain and independent pan for each of them, master volume. 
Version with gui. 

#### Drum_machine2

Drum machine with n instruments, independent gain and independent pan for each of them, master volume. 
This version is an abstract version of the previous one. The user can also select the file to play a run time. 
Version with gui. 

#### Synthetizer 

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
